          What is a cookie? Cookies are small data files that are placed on your
          computer or mobile device when you visit a website, mobile app or use
          an online product. Cookies are widely used to facilitate and help to
          make the interaction between users and websites, mobile apps and
          online products faster and easier, as well as to provide reporting
          information. We use two types of cookies on our Websites: Cookies set
          by Framer are called first party cookies and cookies set by parties
          other than Framer are called third party cookies. You can find out
          more about each cookie by viewing our current cookie list below. We
          may also collect information using web beacons (also known as
          "tracking pixels"). Web beacons are electronic images that may be used
          in our Websites or notifications and help deliver cookies, count
          visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine
          whether a notification has been opened and acted upon. We may also
          receive reports based on the use of these technologies by our
          service/analytics providers such as Google Analytics. If you want to
          learn more about cookies, or how to control, disable or delete them,
